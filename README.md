# FuzzyLogic-IK
This project presents a novel and efficient method for calculating inverse kinematic solutions on small devices using KANs


## TO DO
* Create the simulation and collect data (Done)
* Train the KAN models for all the robot configuration (Anio)
* Extract the mathematical equations from the KAN model (Anio)
* Compare with other methods such as MLP based Fuzzy Logic and linear algebra (Ashwin)
* Evalute the time and space complexity of each method (Ashwin)
* Write paper (Ashwin + Anio)
